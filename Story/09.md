Chapter 9: Enter Luca Martello


---

Scene 1: The Awkward Meeting

The café near the Vatican was small but charming, filled with ancient books and dusty artifacts tucked into corners. The low hum of quiet conversation and the sharp scent of strong espresso filled the air. Isabella sat next to Marco at a worn wooden table, her fingers lightly tracing the rim of her cup. The mood was tense—Isabella could feel it in the way Marco shifted his weight every few minutes, checking his watch as they waited.

“He’ll show up,” Marco muttered, sensing Isabella’s quiet impatience.

“I’m sure he will,” she replied softly, her voice calm but curious. She was about to meet Luca Martello, someone Marco said might hold the key to understanding the cryptic research her grandfather had left behind.

A few minutes later, the door to the café swung open with a soft jingle of bells, and in stepped a tall, skinny man with wire-rimmed glasses perched on the bridge of his nose. He was impeccably dressed, his gray suit crisp and spotless. His sharp eyes darted around the room before landing on Marco. With a thin-lipped smile, Luca Martello strode toward them with a calculated grace, every movement deliberate, as if he were already mentally cataloging the café’s contents for some future lecture.

“Marco,” Luca greeted, his voice dripping with condescension as he took the seat opposite them without waiting for an invitation. “Always nice to see you indulging in these… pedestrian establishments.” He glanced around the café, wrinkling his nose slightly at the worn furniture.

“Good to see you too, Luca,” Marco replied, forcing a grin as he leaned back in his chair. “Thanks for meeting us on short notice.”

Luca waved a hand dismissively. “Oh, please. I have a bit of time between more pressing engagements.” He adjusted his glasses and then gave Isabella a fleeting glance before returning his focus to Marco. It was clear he wasn’t even interested in asking who she was.

“So,” Luca continued, not waiting for Marco to speak. “I assume this is about your little catacombs project, yes? I’m sure you’re hopelessly lost without my help.” His voice was filled with arrogance, as if he relished in Marco’s need for his expertise.

Isabella raised an eyebrow at Luca’s tone, but remained silent, studying him closely.

Marco cleared his throat. “Yeah, the inscriptions in the catacombs. We found something unusual.”

“Unusual?” Luca scoffed, leaning forward slightly, his eyes gleaming behind his glasses. “Please, Marco, there’s nothing in those catacombs that I haven’t already studied extensively. You wouldn’t know the difference between a 4th-century Christian epitaph and a medieval forgery if it hit you in the face.”

Isabella couldn’t help but smirk at the jab, though she quickly masked her expression. Marco’s jaw clenched, but he let the insult slide.

“We figured that out,” Marco said, his voice tight with irritation. “That’s why we brought you in.”

Luca gave a smug nod, pleased with the recognition. “I assumed as much. You should be grateful I found the time. My latest project has me buried in volumes about early Christian martyrdom. Just yesterday, I was in the archives examining original documents that most scholars can only dream of handling.” His eyes gleamed with pride as he droned on. “It’s remarkable how much we don’t know about the early Church, especially when it comes to the conflicts between the Apostolic Fathers. But of course, it takes someone with my expertise to sift through the myths and the real history.”

Isabella shifted slightly in her seat. Luca’s pompous air filled the space between them, suffocating the conversation before it could even begin properly. Marco shot her an apologetic glance.

“Have you ever considered the symbolism in early Christian art?” Luca continued, barely pausing to let either of them get a word in. “The untrained eye completely misses the layers of meaning. It’s not just about fish and anchors, you know. Take the chi-rho symbol, for instance—most people think it’s a simple monogram for Christ, but it goes so much deeper. If only they could understand what it really represents.”

Isabella listened, her eyes narrowing slightly as Luca rambled on. He had yet to acknowledge her presence properly, which didn’t surprise her. Men like Luca rarely took notice of anyone they didn’t consider an intellectual equal—or worse, someone they assumed wouldn’t understand the gravity of their work.

Marco finally tried to redirect the conversation. “Luca, we’ve come across something that’s a bit outside my expertise. Some inscriptions that don’t match anything I’ve seen before.”

“Well, of course they wouldn’t match anything you’ve seen,” Luca interrupted, puffing out his chest as if that was the most obvious thing in the world. “Inscriptions are an entirely different language, Marco, one that you need years—decades—of study to even begin to understand. You can’t just wander through history as if it’s some kind of scavenger hunt.”

Isabella bit her lip, holding back a comment. Luca’s tone made it clear he enjoyed belittling Marco’s contributions, and by extension, hers as well. His thin fingers tapped impatiently on the table as he spoke, and he didn’t once make eye contact with her.

“You’re lucky to have me,” Luca went on, adjusting his glasses again, even though they didn’t seem to need it. “I could be giving a lecture right now at the Vatican Library, but instead, here I am, helping you decipher something you probably don’t even understand.”

Marco bristled at the remark, but before he could respond, Luca’s gaze shifted to Isabella—finally, after several minutes of completely ignoring her.

“And who is this?” Luca asked, his tone dismissive. “A friend of yours? Perhaps someone who enjoys these quaint little mysteries you get yourself involved in?”

Marco glanced at Isabella, hesitating for just a second. “This is Isabella,” he said, keeping his introduction deliberately vague.

Luca barely blinked. “Isabella,” he repeated, his voice flat, as if the name carried no weight for him. “Well, I suppose even amateurs can enjoy a puzzle or two.”

Isabella smiled politely, though the warmth didn’t reach her eyes. “I do enjoy puzzles,” she said, her voice steady. “Especially when they lead to something meaningful.”

Luca made a sound that was half a laugh, half a scoff. “Oh, meaning. That’s always what people are searching for, isn’t it? But most don’t have the tools to find it.” He leaned back in his chair, folding his arms smugly across his chest. “Meaning is in the details, the history, the context. Not everyone is equipped to understand that.”

Marco gave Isabella a sideways glance, as if to say told you so. Luca was being just as arrogant and obnoxious as he had warned her.

Luca, oblivious to the tension building at the table, continued. “But enough about that. What exactly did you find in the catacombs, Marco? I assume it’s something that stumped you enough to drag me into this.”

Isabella leaned forward, deciding to test the waters. “It’s not just the catacombs, Mr. Martello. There’s a lot more at stake than you might think.”

Luca raised an eyebrow, intrigued for the first time. But before Isabella could say more, Marco shot her a look, silently telling her to hold off. They weren’t ready to reveal everything just yet.

Instead, Isabella smiled, hiding her impatience. “I’m sure someone of your expertise will find it fascinating,” she said.

Luca smirked, as if the compliment was only his due. “Oh, I’m sure I will.”

Scene 2: The Shift in Atmosphere

The tension at the table was palpable as Luca continued his arrogant monologue, clearly enjoying the sound of his own voice. Marco shifted in his seat, growing impatient. It was time to move the conversation forward.

“Luca,” Marco interrupted, his voice cutting through Luca’s ongoing rant about early Christian iconography. “Let’s get to the point. We’re not here to discuss symbols.”

Luca raised an eyebrow, slightly taken aback at being interrupted so abruptly. “Oh? And what is it, exactly, that you’re so eager to discuss?”

Marco leaned forward, his voice lowering slightly. “This is about Giovanni Benedetti’s work. His exploration into the Vatican’s hidden history.”

Luca’s demeanor shifted instantly. The smug expression on his face faltered, replaced by a flicker of genuine interest. “Giovanni Benedetti?” he repeated, his voice softer, almost reverent.

Marco nodded. “Yes. Isabella,” he gestured toward her, “is his granddaughter.”

For the first time, Luca truly looked at Isabella, his gaze sharp and assessing. The casual indifference in his eyes was gone, replaced by something more intense, almost awestruck. “You’re his granddaughter?” he asked, leaning forward slightly, his arrogance giving way to a newfound fascination.

Isabella nodded slowly, unsure of how to respond to the sudden change in Luca’s demeanor. She had expected some curiosity, but the almost childlike reverence in his voice surprised her.

Luca straightened up, his thin fingers drumming lightly on the table as he processed the information. “Giovanni Benedetti,” he repeated, as if savoring the name. “The man was a genius—no, more than that. A visionary. His work on early Christian history, the documents he uncovered… everything he said was like a postulate. Unquestionable, groundbreaking.” He adjusted his glasses, suddenly animated in a way that made his previous arrogance seem almost distant.

Isabella watched him, intrigued. Luca’s transformation was striking—he was no longer the aloof, condescending scholar. Instead, he looked like a child who had just discovered his hero was real and sitting across the table from him. She hadn’t expected this.

“Your grandfather’s contributions to Vatican history were unparalleled,” Luca continued, his voice filled with excitement. “He wasn’t just uncovering facts; he was redefining the way we understood our past. His lectures—legendary. The way he pieced together obscure fragments of history that no one else could see… the man was ahead of his time. I’ve spent years studying his work.” His eyes gleamed behind his glasses as he spoke, as if reliving the thrill of Giovanni’s discoveries.

Isabella couldn’t help but smile slightly at Luca’s enthusiasm. The abrupt shift from arrogant to awestruck was almost amusing. She could see the deep admiration he had for her grandfather, and it was clear that Giovanni’s legacy still held immense power over Luca, even years after his death.

Marco leaned back in his chair, watching Luca with a bemused expression. “Yeah, that’s why we’re here,” he said, breaking Luca’s flow. “There’s something Giovanni found before he died—something big. And we need your help to figure it out.”

Luca’s eyes widened, his excitement growing. “Something he found? Before his death?” His voice was practically trembling with anticipation. “Tell me more. What did he discover?”

Marco glanced at Isabella, silently encouraging her to speak. Isabella hesitated for a moment, then leaned forward slightly. “We don’t know all the details,” she said carefully. “But my grandfather left behind some research—notes, inscriptions, hidden messages. We think they point to something buried deep within the Vatican’s history. Something… important.”

Luca’s breath hitched, and for the first time, he seemed at a loss for words. His fingers twitched as if he were itching to get his hands on the research. “Giovanni’s research…” he whispered, almost to himself. “If he was onto something… it must be extraordinary. He wouldn’t waste his time on trivial matters.”

He leaned even closer, his intense gaze locking onto Isabella. “You have his notes?” he asked, his voice barely a whisper. “You’ve seen them?”

Isabella nodded. “Yes, but they’re incomplete. There are pieces missing, and we don’t know where they lead. That’s why we need your help.”

Luca’s eyes sparkled with excitement, and for the first time, he seemed genuinely humbled. “I’ll help,” he said, his voice filled with fervor. “Whatever it is, if Giovanni was involved, I’ll do whatever it takes to uncover the truth.”

Marco smirked slightly, exchanging a glance with Isabella. Luca’s arrogance had melted away, replaced by a passionate admiration for her grandfather. The atmosphere at the table had shifted dramatically—Luca was no longer the stiff, pompous scholar they had first encountered. He was now deeply engaged, eager to dive into the mystery.

Isabella leaned back, her mind racing. This was the first time she had seen someone react to her grandfather’s legacy with such intensity. Luca’s knowledge, combined with his clear devotion to Giovanni’s work, could be the key to unraveling the cryptic messages her grandfather had left behind. The thought both excited and unsettled her.

“So,” Luca said, his voice now steady with purpose. “Where do we begin?”

Scene 3: Luca's Revelation

The café had grown quieter as the afternoon wore on, the once bustling atmosphere now subdued. The conversation between the three at the table, however, was far from quiet. Luca was practically vibrating with energy, his earlier arrogance forgotten as he leaned closer to Isabella and Marco, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper.

"I have something you need to see," Luca said, his glasses catching the dim light of the café as he adjusted them. "I’ve been studying Giovanni's journal for years."

Isabella’s eyebrows shot up. “You have his journal?”

Luca nodded, his expression serious. “Not just any journal—the journal. The one he kept during the last years of his research into early Christianity, just before his death. It’s full of his notes, observations, and theories. But…” He hesitated for a moment, his fingers tapping nervously on the edge of the table. “Every time I’ve come close to a conclusion, to understanding the heart of what he was working on, there’s always something… missing.”

Isabella’s heart skipped a beat. Her grandfather’s journal? The thought sent a chill through her. “Missing how?” she asked, her voice quiet but steady.

Luca sighed, leaning back in his chair. “It’s hard to explain. Giovanni was meticulous—he wrote down everything, every thought, every hypothesis. But when it comes to the key points in his research, it’s like there’s a gap. As if he left out something crucial on purpose, or maybe he intended to hide it.”

Marco frowned, crossing his arms. “Are you saying he was keeping secrets? From who?”

“Not from me,” Luca replied quickly, almost defensively. “But maybe from someone else. From the Vatican, perhaps. It’s not uncommon for scholars to omit certain findings when they fear the consequences of their discovery.”

Isabella leaned forward, her mind racing. “What exactly was he researching? Do you know?”

Luca’s eyes gleamed behind his glasses, his excitement returning. “Early Christianity. Specifically, he was investigating how certain doctrines were altered—compromised—to fit political or cultural narratives over the centuries. Giovanni was convinced that something had been buried, something fundamental to the original teachings of Jesus. He believed that uncovering this truth would change everything.”

Marco raised an eyebrow. “That sounds… dangerous.”

Luca nodded. “Exactly. That’s why I’ve been so obsessed with his work. I believe he was onto something monumental. But as I said, there’s always been something missing. Something I couldn’t quite grasp.”

Isabella exchanged a glance with Marco, her thoughts swirling. “You think my grandfather’s death was connected to this?”

Luca’s expression turned grim. “It’s possible. Giovanni wasn’t just a scholar—he was a man who knew too much. If what he found was as important as I think it was, there are plenty of people who would have wanted to silence him.”

The weight of Luca’s words hung in the air. Isabella felt a cold knot of dread forming in her stomach. She had always suspected that her grandfather’s death wasn’t as simple as it appeared, but hearing Luca’s theory made it feel more real, more dangerous.

Luca leaned forward again, his voice lowering. “That’s why I need your help, Isabella. You have access to things I don’t. Your grandfather may have left clues with you, hidden in plain sight, without you even realizing it.”

Isabella hesitated, unsure of how to respond. The idea that she held the missing piece to her grandfather’s puzzle was overwhelming. She had always felt a deep connection to him, but this was different—this was real, tangible.

“I found some of his papers,” she said quietly. “Some inscriptions, notes… I didn’t understand all of it, but maybe—”

Luca’s eyes lit up. “That’s exactly what we need. If we combine what you’ve found with his journal, we might finally be able to piece together the missing parts. We can figure out what Giovanni was really working on.”

Marco, who had been silently watching the exchange, finally spoke up. “And then what? What happens if we actually figure this out? Are we ready for what comes next?”

Luca looked at him, his expression serious. “If Giovanni was right, and we uncover the truth… then everything changes. For the Vatican, for Christianity, for the world.”

The gravity of his words settled over the table like a heavy fog. Isabella felt a strange mixture of fear and excitement building within her. She had always known that her grandfather’s work was important, but now it seemed bigger than she could have ever imagined.

She glanced at Marco, who gave her a small, reassuring nod. They were in this together.

“I want to see the journal,” she said finally, her voice steady.

Luca smiled, his earlier arrogance replaced by a genuine excitement. “You’ll see it. We’ll work together, Isabella. With your grandfather’s legacy and what we discover, we might just change the course of history.”

Scene 4: The Weight of History

The café had quieted down even more, the low hum of conversations fading into the background. It was as if the world outside their table had paused, allowing the three of them to confront the enormity of what lay ahead.

Luca sat back in his chair, his fingers absentmindedly tapping on the table. His earlier excitement had given way to something more somber, more reflective. “You don’t just go digging around in history without consequences,” he said, his voice quiet but firm. “Especially when it’s history that powerful people want buried.”

Isabella looked at him, the weight of his words sinking in. “What do you mean? Has something like this happened before?”

Luca adjusted his glasses, a flicker of unease crossing his face. “More times than you’d think. Scholars, historians, archaeologists—people who’ve dared to question the official narrative or uncover truths that the authorities don’t want revealed. They either disappear, or worse.”

Marco, who had been listening quietly, leaned forward. “I’ve seen it firsthand. People like us, people who dig too deep, they end up in trouble. Sometimes, they don’t even realize what they’re getting into until it’s too late.”

Isabella felt a chill run down her spine. “Do you think my grandfather knew what kind of danger he was in?”

Luca’s face grew grim. “Giovanni was no fool. He must have known that what he was working on was dangerous. But he was also determined. Once he set his mind to uncovering the truth, there was no turning back. That’s the kind of man he was.”

Marco nodded in agreement. “He wasn’t the first, and he won’t be the last. There was a historian I knew years ago. He was researching early church documents, something about how certain texts were altered or suppressed. He didn’t get far before he started receiving threats. He kept going, thought he could handle it. A few months later, he disappeared. His research was destroyed, and no one ever saw him again.”

Isabella’s stomach tightened. “And you think… we could be facing the same thing?”

Luca didn’t answer immediately. He glanced at Marco before turning back to Isabella. “It’s possible. Giovanni was on the verge of something huge. If we get too close to the same truth, we’ll be walking the same path. And the Vatican—well, they don’t take kindly to people unearthing secrets they’ve spent centuries protecting.”

Marco’s eyes hardened. “We’re not just up against scholars or academics here. We’re talking about an institution with two thousand years of history. They’ve survived emperors, wars, revolutions. You think a few curious minds are going to scare them?”

Isabella swallowed, her throat suddenly dry. She had always known her grandfather’s work was important, but she had never imagined it could be this dangerous. “So what do we do? Do we stop?”

Luca shook his head vehemently. “No. We don’t stop. Giovanni didn’t, and neither can we. What he found—whatever it is—it’s too important. If we turn back now, everything he sacrificed will have been for nothing.”

Marco leaned in closer, his voice low and urgent. “But we need to be smart about this. We can’t go charging in without a plan. The Vatican has eyes everywhere. If they catch wind of what we’re doing, we won’t just be dealing with threats. We’ll be dealing with something much worse.”

Luca nodded. “Marco’s right. We need to be careful, strategic. We can’t afford to make any mistakes.”

Isabella felt the weight of their words pressing down on her. She had always been driven by a need to uncover the truth about her grandfather’s death, but now it seemed like that truth came with a price—a price she wasn’t sure she was ready to pay.

Still, the thought of turning back now, of letting her grandfather’s work remain unfinished, was unbearable. “I’m not stopping,” she said quietly, but with a determined edge to her voice. “Whatever it takes, I want to know the truth.”

Luca gave her a small, approving nod. “Good. We’re in this together.”

For a moment, the three of them sat in silence, the gravity of their situation hanging heavily between them. Then, out of the corner of her eye, Isabella noticed something—a figure, sitting at a table near the entrance, watching them. The figure wasn’t moving, just observing, and something about the way they were positioned made Isabella’s heart race.

“Marco,” she said quietly, her voice barely above a whisper. “We’re being watched.”

Marco’s eyes flicked to where she was looking, his expression darkening. He turned back to Luca and Isabella, keeping his voice low. “Act normal. Don’t draw attention.”

Luca’s face paled as he followed Marco’s gaze. “They found us already?”

Marco shook his head slightly. “Maybe. Maybe it’s just a coincidence. But we’re not taking any chances. We’re leaving. Now.”

Isabella’s pulse quickened as Marco stood up, moving calmly but purposefully. Luca grabbed his bag, trying to keep his composure as he followed Marco’s lead. Isabella glanced one last time at the figure by the door before getting up herself, her heart pounding in her chest.

As they exited the café, Isabella couldn’t shake the feeling that this was only the beginning. Whatever secrets her grandfather had uncovered, they were dangerous—and now, they were all in the crosshairs of something much bigger than they had ever anticipated.

Scene 5: The Unseen Watcher

Just as they were preparing to leave, Isabella’s gaze drifted toward the window. A figure stood across the street, their face hidden in the shadows. A chill ran down her spine as the figure’s attention seemed to be locked on their table.

“Marco,” Isabella whispered, nudging him slightly.

Marco followed her gaze, his eyes narrowing. “We’re being watched.”

Luca stiffened, clutching the journal tightly. “Who—?”

“No time to ask,” Marco muttered. “We need to move. Now.”

They quickly gathered their things, but as they stepped out of the café, Isabella caught a glimpse of the figure stepping into the light. Her breath caught in her throat as the familiar face registered.

It was someone she never thought she’d see again.

Cliffhanger:

The revelation hit her like a wave, threatening to pull her under. A face from the past, long buried, now resurfaced in the shadows of the Vatican. Isabella’s world was about to unravel in ways she could never have imagined.
