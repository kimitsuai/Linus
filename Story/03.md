Chapter 3: Return to Italy

The distant hum of Fiumicino Airport echoed softly around Isabella Benedetti as she stood still, her luggage clutched tightly by her side. The late afternoon light filtering through the airport windows cast a hazy glow, and for a moment, she felt suspended in time, neither in her present nor her past. Rome, her home, the city of her childhood, was once again within her reach, yet everything felt different. It had been years since she'd left Italy—first for school, then for her career in the United States—and the emotional chasm between her and her past had only widened in that time. Now, returning felt like an inevitability she could no longer delay. The weight of her family’s tragedy had drawn her back, but the questions swirling around her grandfather’s murder, and the lingering mysteries in his life, pulled at her like an invisible tether.

Isabella watched the passengers scurry through the airport, mothers guiding young children, businessmen briskly walking past with briefcases, and couples holding hands, smiling as they returned from their travels. She wasn’t like them. Her return was not one of joy or reunion, but of unease.

Her phone buzzed, a message from Roberto, her uncle, confirming he’d be waiting for her at the house. She didn’t respond. Instead, she closed her eyes and inhaled deeply, letting the scent of polished floors, the faint odor of jet fuel, and the metallic tang of the air conditioning ground her. It was time to face the past she’d long avoided. The moment had come.

She pushed her way through the glass doors of the terminal and into the cool Roman evening. A breeze brushed her face, bringing with it the scent of pine trees and distant exhaust fumes. The taxi line was short, and as she slid into the back seat of the car, she felt her heart quicken, both from the anticipation of being home and the gnawing discomfort of what awaited her there.

“Where to, signora?” the cab driver asked, breaking her from her thoughts.

Isabella hesitated before giving the address to her grandparents' home. As the cab pulled away from the airport, she stared out at the skyline, watching the familiar sights of Rome blur past. The Colosseum, its ancient arches glowing in the dim light, the crowded streets, the distant chatter of Roman life—it was all the same and yet entirely different from what she remembered.

The cab turned onto a quiet, upscale street nestled in the heart of Rome, and as the car slowed in front of her grandparents' house, Isabella felt the weight of years settle onto her shoulders. The house stood as a silent sentinel, much like it always had, though now it seemed colder, emptier. She stepped out of the cab, her heels clicking against the stone driveway as she approached the front door. The house had once been full of life, laughter, the smell of her grandmother’s cooking wafting through the hallways, and the sound of her grandfather’s voice booming from his study as he discussed his latest research with colleagues. Now, it was only a shell, the echoes of a time long past.

The door creaked open, and Roberto stood in the entryway. He was older than she remembered, his once jet-black hair now streaked with gray, his face weathered by the years. There was an awkwardness between them, a hesitation that hadn’t been there when she was a child.

“Isabella,” he greeted, his voice low, almost reverent, as though speaking too loudly might shatter the fragile air between them.

“Uncle Roberto,” she replied, her voice softer than she intended.

They stood there for a moment, unsure of how to navigate the years of distance that had grown between them. He stepped aside, allowing her to enter. The house was just as she remembered, though the warmth was gone. The air was cold and still, the furniture covered in white sheets, untouched since her grandparents had passed. It felt like a museum, frozen in time.

“I’ve kept everything the way it was,” Roberto said as if reading her thoughts. “Giovanni’s study... it's exactly as he left it.”

Isabella nodded, her throat tightening. She had always been close to her grandfather, Giovanni Benedetti. He had been a brilliant man, a historian revered in Vatican circles, but there had always been an air of mystery around him. His murder had sent shockwaves through the family, but no one had ever been able to explain why he was killed. Now, as she returned to the house, the grief of his loss mingled with the mystery that still surrounded his death.

“Do you want to see the study?” Roberto asked cautiously, his eyes studying her face.

Isabella hesitated but then nodded. “Yes, I think I do.”

The study was just as she remembered. The walls were lined with bookshelves, crammed with volumes of history, theology, and philosophy. The scent of old paper and leather bindings filled the room, and the desk in the center was cluttered with notes, papers, and books—frozen in time, just as Roberto had promised.

Isabella walked slowly to the desk, her fingers brushing the surface lightly. She could almost hear her grandfather’s voice in the room, explaining one of his theories or laughing at something she had said. The room had always been her sanctuary, a place where she could escape the noise of the outside world and bask in her grandfather’s presence.

But now, standing here alone, all she could think about was the emptiness. The unresolved grief over her parents’ deaths, which had taken place when she was only seven years old, bubbled up inside her. They had left for a Vatican trip, something routine, but they had never returned. The accident had taken them both, leaving her in the care of her grandparents. The grief she had carried since then had never truly left her.

As her fingers brushed the corner of one of Giovanni’s old journals, something caught her eye—a small, folded piece of paper sticking out between the pages. Isabella pulled it out, unfolding it carefully. It was an old note, the handwriting unmistakable—her grandfather’s.

The note was cryptic, mentioning dates, events, and a few names she didn’t recognize. It was incomplete, cut off abruptly. A chill ran down her spine. What was Giovanni working on before his death? What had he discovered that might have led to his murder?

Later that night, Isabella sat in the kitchen with Roberto, nursing a glass of wine. The room was dimly lit, casting long shadows across the floor. There was a heaviness in the air, a weight that neither of them could seem to lift.

“I’m sorry,” Roberto said suddenly, his voice rough with emotion. “I should have been there for you after your parents died. I should have done more.”

Isabella looked up at him, her eyes softening. “You did what you could, Roberto. We all did.”

He shook his head, his face etched with guilt. “No. I failed you. I failed Giovanni, too.”

There was a long silence between them, the unspoken grief hanging in the air like a heavy fog.

“Do you think... do you think there’s more to his death than we know?” Isabella asked quietly, her voice barely above a whisper.

Roberto’s eyes flickered with something she couldn’t quite place. He set his glass down carefully on the table, his hands trembling slightly. “There’s always been more, Isabella. The Vatican... it’s not as simple as it seems.”

Isabella leaned forward, her heart quickening. “What do you mean?”

Roberto hesitated, his eyes darkening. “Your grandfather was working on something before he died. Something important. I didn’t understand it all, but I know it had to do with certain events in the Vatican’s history... things they didn’t want exposed.”

“Do you have any idea what it was?” Isabella pressed, her mind racing.

“I don’t know the details,” Roberto admitted. “But I do know this: whatever he was working on, it got him killed.”

Unable to sleep, Isabella found herself once again in her grandfather’s study, the note from earlier clutched in her hand. The room was dark, lit only by the faint glow of the moon through the window. She sat at the desk, unfolding the note again, her eyes scanning the cryptic writing.

She began to piece together fragments of her grandfather’s research, connecting the dots between names and dates that felt strangely familiar. The deeper she delved into the notes, the more she realized that this was no ordinary research—Giovanni had stumbled upon something bigger, something dangerous.

As her mind raced, she suddenly heard a noise outside the study. Her heart skipped a beat. The sound was faint but unmistakable—someone was outside.

Isabella stood up quickly, her heart pounding in her chest. She moved toward the window, her breath catching in her throat. Outside, in the darkness, she could make out a shadowy figure disappearing into the night.

Her pulse quickened. Was someone watching her?
