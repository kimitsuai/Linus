Scene 1: Arriving in Rome

The glow of the setting sun painted the glass windows of Rome’s Fiumicino Airport in hues of amber and gold. Isabella stepped through the terminal, her heels echoing in the near-deserted hall. The moment she breathed in the crisp autumn air, a flood of memories surged—her childhood summers with her grandparents, and the fateful night when it all crumbled.

Her fingers clenched the leather handle of her suitcase. She stood still, gazing outside. Rome felt foreign yet familiar, like a song she hadn’t heard in years but knew every word to. I shouldn't have come back..., she thought, though it was too late to turn back now.

As she entered a taxi, her gaze drifted over the city’s skyline. The ancient architecture blurred as the car sped through narrow streets, and an uneasy heaviness settled over her chest. The closer she got to her childhood home, the more she could feel the past tugging at her.

"Signora, siamo arrivati."

Isabella blinked. The taxi had stopped. She stepped out and stared at the tall gates of the house that once symbolized warmth and family. Now, it felt like a mausoleum of her memories.

Scene 2: Memories of Home

Isabella’s grandparents’ house in a quiet, upscale neighborhood in Rome. Nightfall. The air is heavy with nostalgia, the house shrouded in the silence of years gone by.

Isabella steps out of the car and gazes up at the house. The windows are dark, the stone walls seeming taller than she remembered. She clutches the strap of her handbag tighter, her heart racing as memories flood back—her last visit, her grandfather’s gentle voice, her grandmother’s laughter.

She hesitates before walking toward the front door. It’s slightly ajar, light spilling into the cold evening air. Roberto appears in the doorway, his familiar face marked by the passage of time. He nods, almost nervously, and gestures her in.

Roberto: (quietly) "Isabella... it’s good to see you. It’s been... too long."

Isabella: (awkward smile) "It has, Uncle Roberto." She pauses, not knowing what else to say. Her eyes drift to the interior of the house.

The hallway is just as she remembered—elegant, but now eerily quiet, as if waiting for voices that would never return. The ticking of the old grandfather clock fills the silence, echoing through the hallway. Isabella steps inside, and for a moment, she’s five years old again, running toward her grandfather’s study to tell him about her day.

Roberto watches her, his eyes soft with a mix of nostalgia and worry. He clears his throat as they walk slowly into the living room.

Roberto: (nervous) "I’ve... kept everything as it was. You know, after... after they passed. I wasn’t sure what to change."

Isabella: (softly) "I’m glad. It feels like... they’re still here." She looks around, taking in the preserved furniture, the family photos on the mantelpiece, the worn leather chair where Giovanni used to sit.

Roberto walks over to the fireplace and picks up a small framed picture of Giovanni, holding it with a wistful smile.

Roberto: "Your grandfather… he was always so proud of you. You know that, right? He’d talk about your accomplishments to anyone who’d listen."

Isabella gives a small, tight smile but says nothing. Her fingers brush the edge of the bookshelf, remembering how Giovanni would sit her down, pointing out his favorite books, sharing stories from history.

Roberto: (awkwardly changing the subject) "There’s… uh, his study. I haven’t touched anything in there since... since the day it happened. Figured it should stay the way he left it."

Isabella’s heart clenches. She looks toward the hallway, knowing what waits behind the door. She hadn’t been in there since that terrible day.

They walk toward the study in silence. The old door creaks as Roberto pushes it open. The room smells faintly of leather and old paper, as if Giovanni had just stepped out and would return any moment. Bookshelves line the walls, packed with volumes, and his writing desk remains cluttered with notes, papers, and an open journal.

Isabella steps inside, her throat tight. The flood of memories is overwhelming—Giovanni sitting at that very desk, turning to smile at her as she showed him a picture she’d drawn. The room felt safe then, a world away from the tragic loss that followed.

Isabella: (whispering) "It’s exactly the same..." She runs her fingers over the desk, a soft smile tugging at her lips despite the ache in her chest. "I remember sitting here, listening to him talk about... everything. History, life, his work. He had so much to say."

Roberto watches her, his face conflicted. He steps closer to her, glancing at the papers still scattered across the desk.

Roberto: (softly) "You were the light in his world, Isabella. He never stopped talking about the future he wanted for you. But... there were things he didn’t share with us. Not fully."

Isabella turns to him, her brows furrowing.

Isabella: "What do you mean? He always seemed so open."

Roberto: (sighing) "I’ve been looking through some of his notes, his papers. He was working on something. Something big. I think it’s what got him killed."

The words hang heavy in the air. Isabella’s stomach twists. She feels a surge of conflicting emotions—grief, curiosity, anger.

Isabella: (sharply) "You think it was related to his research?"

Roberto: (nodding) "I never wanted to believe it, but there are things I found. Letters. Warnings. He didn’t tell us everything. Not even me."

There’s a long silence. Isabella turns to the bookshelf, her eyes scanning the familiar titles. She pulls out an old leather-bound book, one of Giovanni’s favorites. As she flips through the pages, a note falls out.

She bends down, picking it up. It’s old, the edges yellowed. Giovanni’s handwriting is unmistakable, but the words are cryptic, as if meant to hide something.

Isabella: (softly, reading) "‘The truth must be protected, but at what cost? I cannot risk everything I’ve worked for, but silence could be just as dangerous.’"

Roberto: (grimly) "That’s what I mean. He was onto something. And I think it’s still out there, waiting to be uncovered."

Isabella feels a chill run down her spine. The weight of her grandfather’s legacy presses down on her, heavier than ever before. She turns to Roberto, her voice quiet but determined.

Isabella: "I need to know what happened, Uncle Roberto. I need to find out what he was working on."

Roberto: (looking at her with a mix of pride and sadness) "I thought you’d say that. But be careful, Isabella. Whatever he was caught up in… it’s dangerous. It could still be dangerous for you."

Isabella stands in the center of the study, the past and present colliding around her. She feels a renewed sense of purpose but also a deep ache in her chest. Giovanni’s ghost seems to linger in the room, watching over her as she steps toward the path he left unfinished.

Isabella: (whispering to herself) "I’ll find out, Nonno. I promise."

Isabella holding the note tightly, her gaze locked on her grandfather’s desk, the weight of the investigation ahead settling over her.

Scene 3: The Weight of Her Parents' Deaths

Isabella sat in Giovanni’s chair, closing her eyes as a wave of grief hit her. She was seven when her parents died—gone in a tragic accident while on a Vatican-related trip. She could still hear the echo of her aunt’s voice breaking the news. She's the only survival. They said it was an accident, but even then, it felt like there was more to the story. Her heart still ached from that loss, but now, with her grandfather’s murder, everything was more tangled.

Opening her eyes, she noticed a dusty book on Giovanni’s desk. It was one of his old journals. She flipped through the yellowed pages, stopping when a folded note fell from between the leaves. Unfolding it, she saw cryptic Vatican symbols and names that made her pulse quicken. What were you working on, Nonno?

The mystery surrounding her grandfather’s research began to cloud her mind. Was this note connected to his death? Her fingers trembled as she stared at the unfamiliar names, each one feeling like a key to something dark and dangerous.

Scene 4: Unresolved Grief

Later that night, the house was quiet except for the soft clinking of glasses. Isabella and Roberto sat across from each other in the dimly lit kitchen, the glow of the nightlamp casting long shadows. Roberto poured them both a drink—whiskey, their family’s tradition for heavy conversations.

“I’m sorry I wasn’t there for you... after your parents,” Roberto said, his eyes focused on the glass in his hand.

Isabella shrugged. “We all have our ways of dealing with grief.”

Roberto sighed, the weight of years passing between them. “There’s something you need to know... about Giovanni’s death.”

Isabella looked up sharply. “You mean the murder?”

He hesitated, swirling the liquid in his glass. “Things in the Vatican aren’t as simple as they seem. Your grandfather... he knew something. Something big.”

“What are you talking about, Roberto?”

He glanced around the kitchen, as if the walls had ears. “There’s a conspiracy—a secret order. Your grandfather was getting too close to uncovering it. That’s why you’re here, Isabella. We need to figure out what Giovanni was onto before... well, before anyone else does.”

Isabella’s heart raced. She had come back to bury her grief, not to dig up a conspiracy. But Roberto’s words opened up a door she couldn’t close.

Scene 5: The First Clue

Setting: Giovanni’s study, late at night. The room is dimly lit, the smell of old paper and ink heavy in the air. Isabella, restless and burdened by unanswered questions, returns to the study, unable to sleep. The house is silent, save for the faint ticking of the old clock.

Isabella sits at her grandfather's desk, the weight of Roberto’s revelation gnawing at her mind. The room feels colder now, as if the air itself holds secrets. She unfolds the old note Giovanni had left behind and smooths it out on the desk, her eyes narrowing as she scans the cryptic symbols and names once again.

Isabella: (whispering to herself) "Nero’s Order..."

The words feel foreign in her mouth, heavy with meaning yet shrouded in mystery. Her fingers trace the inked letters as if touching them would somehow bring clarity. But the more she stares at the symbols, the more questions flood her mind.

Why would Giovanni write this? Why hide something so dangerous in a note, knowing someone could find it? Was he trying to protect me... or was it a warning?

She turns the paper over, looking for any hidden marks or additional clues. Her breath comes slow and deliberate, the atmosphere thick with tension.

Isabella: (thinking, her voice soft but urgent) "Nero’s Order... It sounds like a cult, or maybe an ancient society. But how is it connected to the Vatican?"

Her mind races, trying to piece together the fragments of memory. Giovanni had always been fascinated by history—especially the dark corners of it, the parts no one else dared to touch. Was this one of those hidden truths he uncovered? Something dangerous enough to get him killed?

She stands up, pacing the room, unable to shake the feeling that there’s something she’s missing. Every detail, every cryptic symbol, feels like a piece of a puzzle she doesn’t yet have all the parts for.

Isabella: (to herself, frustrated) "Why didn’t he tell me? Why leave me in the dark?"

She picks up one of the books from Giovanni’s shelf, an old leather-bound tome he had often referenced in his lectures. She flips through the pages, hoping to find some hidden context, something to connect to "Nero’s Order." But the pages are filled with the same historical facts she’s read before, the same academic musings. Nothing stands out.

Was it all in plain sight? Did Giovanni hide clues in his research?

She goes back to the desk, placing the note beside the open book. The cryptic symbols seem to mock her now, daring her to understand them. She closes her eyes for a moment, breathing deeply. She needs to think clearly.

Isabella: (murmuring) "Nero... Emperor Nero... persecution of Christians... but why now? Why would Grandfather mention him after all these years?"

Her fingers hover over the journal, flipping through pages filled with Giovanni's tidy, careful handwriting. Names. Dates. Half-finished thoughts. A timeline of something she doesn’t fully comprehend yet. One name catches her eye—Caius Maximus.

Isabella: (quietly, reading) "Caius Maximus? I’ve seen this name before…"

She rifles through her memories, trying to remember where she had encountered that name. It was familiar, but distant, buried in the haze of her grandfather’s lectures or perhaps his old papers. Her pulse quickens.

Isabella: (thinking) "Was he an ally? Or someone Giovanni was warning me about?"

Her eyes shift to another line, written in Giovanni’s characteristic shorthand: The truth must be protected, but at what cost?

The weight of those words presses on her. Protected from whom? And why?

As she begins to piece the connections together, her mind keeps circling back to Nero’s Order—it must be something ancient, something rooted in history, something Giovanni stumbled upon in his research. But how did it relate to the Vatican? And what truth had Giovanni uncovered that was so dangerous?

Suddenly, a faint noise breaks the heavy silence—a soft rustling sound, just outside the study. Isabella freezes, her heart pounding in her chest. The hairs on the back of her neck stand on end.

She glances toward the window, her breath caught in her throat. At first, she thinks it might be the wind. But then she hears it again, this time louder—definitely footsteps. Her body tenses, her instincts telling her that she’s not alone.

Isabella: (thinking, panicked) "Who’s out there? Did someone follow me?"

Her heart races as she approaches the window, cautiously peeking out from behind the curtains. Outside, beneath the dim glow of the streetlamp, she catches a glimpse of movement. A shadow slips through the gate and disappears into the darkness.

Her blood runs cold.

Isabella: (whispering) "Someone’s watching me."

She steps back from the window, her mind racing. Was it a coincidence? Or had someone been tracking her since she arrived? Her thoughts spiral as fear grips her. Giovanni had warned her, hadn’t he? In his own cryptic way, he had tried to protect her.

But from what? Or who?

Isabella’s breath quickens as she tries to think. If they knew she had found something—if they were watching her—it meant she was on the right track. But it also meant she was in danger.

Isabella: (thinking) "What am I dealing with? What did Grandfather get involved in?"

She looks back at the note, her eyes scanning it with new urgency. There has to be something here, something more than just cryptic phrases and names. She grabs her phone and snaps a picture of the note, just in case.

As she stands there, surrounded by the remnants of her grandfather’s life’s work, she feels the weight of his legacy pressing down on her. He had left her breadcrumbs—Nero’s Order, Caius Maximus, the cryptic symbols—but she doesn’t have the full picture yet. And now, someone else knows she’s looking.

Isabella: (to herself, determined) "I have to find out what this all means... before it’s too late."

Her gaze falls on Giovanni’s desk one last time before she quickly locks the study door behind her. She can’t stay here. Not tonight.

As she makes her way down the hall, her thoughts are consumed by questions, each more pressing than the last. What had her grandfather uncovered? And why were people still after it, decades after his death?

But the most haunting question of all lingers in her mind as she steps out of the house, her eyes scanning the dark streets.

Who was the shadow outside the window?

Cliffhanger

Isabella rushed to the window, but by the time she reached it, the figure was gone, leaving only the soft creak of the gates swinging shut. She pressed her palm against the glass, her mind racing. Who are they? Why are they watching me?

But deep down, she already knew. Whoever it was, they didn’t want her to uncover the secrets her grandfather had died for.
