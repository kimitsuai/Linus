Chapter 17: Niccolo’s Attack: The Chase Through Rome

---

Scene 1: The Ambush

The room was dimly lit, filled with scattered papers and the quiet hum of Isabella’s AI devices. Isabella, Luca, and Marco were gathered around a large wooden table, reviewing the files Giovanni Benedetti had left behind. Luca’s brow was furrowed, deep in thought, while Marco leaned against the wall, smoking a cigarette and staring out of the window.

"These papers...they’re more than just historical documents," Luca mused, tapping a finger against the table. "Giovanni was onto something, something the Church doesn’t want anyone to know."

Isabella nodded, her eyes fixed on the encrypted screen before her. "The AI is still processing the data. There’s more hidden in these files, Luca. Giovanni wasn’t just researching the past—he was uncovering secrets that could tear the Church apart."

Suddenly, a loud crash echoed from the hallway outside, followed by hurried footsteps. Marco’s cigarette fell from his lips as he turned to the door, instincts sharp.

"Someone’s coming," Marco hissed, pushing off the wall. His hand slid to the gun holstered beneath his coat. "We’re not alone."

The door burst open with a violent slam, revealing Niccolo and Francesca, both dressed in black and moving with lethal precision. Niccolo’s eyes locked onto Isabella, and without hesitation, he lunged toward her, knocking over the table in his path. Francesca moved like a shadow, her cold, calculating gaze focused on Luca and Marco.

"Isabella!" Luca shouted, rushing to shield her as Niccolo’s fist swung toward her head.

She ducked just in time, scrambling to grab the briefcase holding the encrypted data. Marco sprang into action, tackling Niccolo before he could land another blow.

Francesca stepped forward, a calm smile playing on her lips as she reached into her jacket. "You really think you can keep those secrets to yourselves?" she said softly, pulling out a sleek black device. "This will all be over soon."

Niccolo shoved Marco off, turning his attention back to Isabella. "Hand it over!" he growled, his voice dark with menace.

"Over my dead body," Isabella snapped, clutching the briefcase to her chest. Her heart raced, but she kept her eyes steady, defiant.

Panic seized the room. Marco, blood trickling from a cut above his eyebrow, stood between Niccolo and Luca as the struggle continued.

"We need to get out of here, now," Luca said urgently, his eyes darting between Isabella and the attackers.

With a desperate glance at her AI system, Isabella tapped a sequence into her phone. "I’ve encrypted everything important. We can’t let them take this."

"Then let’s move," Marco growled, grabbing Isabella’s arm and pulling her toward the back exit.

Scene 2: The Chase Begins

The streets of Rome were a blur of motion as they fled into the night, the sound of their footsteps pounding against the cobblestones. Narrow alleyways twisted and turned, the ancient city’s architecture creating a labyrinth of stone walls and narrow passages.

"Niccolo and Francesca won’t give up easily," Marco muttered, leading the way. "They’ll try to box us in."

Isabella clutched the briefcase tightly, her breath coming in shallow gasps. "We can’t let them get the data," she repeated, her voice filled with determination.

Luca kept pace beside her, glancing over his shoulder. "They’re right behind us," he said, his voice tense. "Marco, where do we go?"

"Trust me," Marco replied, his eyes scanning the streets ahead. "I know these alleys better than they do."

Just as Marco finished speaking, a sharp cry echoed through the alley. Niccolo and Francesca had caught up, and they were closing in fast. The narrow streets were filled with people—locals and tourists—who looked on in confusion as the chase unfolded before them.

"Split up!" Marco shouted, pushing Luca and Isabella toward a side alley. "I’ll lead them away."

Isabella hesitated. "What about you?"

"I’ll be fine," Marco said, flashing a quick grin. "Just keep running!"

Isabella and Luca darted down the narrow passageway, dodging pedestrians and weaving through the crowded streets. Niccolo followed, his eyes fixed on them like a predator stalking its prey.

Luca grabbed Isabella’s hand, pulling her along. "We can lose them in the piazza," he said, glancing at the open square ahead. "There are too many people. We’ll blend in."

They reached the Piazza Navona, the wide-open space filled with the sounds of street performers and bustling crowds. But Niccolo was relentless. He shoved his way through the crowd, his eyes never leaving Isabella.

Luca turned, stepping in front of her. "Keep moving, Isabella. I’ll slow him down."

"No, Luca!" Isabella protested, grabbing his arm. "You don’t have to do this!"

"I have to," he replied, his voice firm. "Go!"

With a reluctant nod, Isabella turned and ran, her heart pounding in her chest. She knew Luca was right—they couldn’t all get caught. But leaving him behind felt like a betrayal.

Scene 3: The Stolen Evidence

The moonlight barely filtered through the thin veil of clouds as Isabella, Luca, and Marco sprinted through the winding streets of Rome, their breath ragged, feet pounding against the cobblestones. They emerged into the vast openness of Piazza Navona, the iconic fountains and statues casting eerie shadows under the dim streetlights. The square, usually alive with tourists and vendors, was now a desolate battleground.

“Keep moving!” Marco barked, his eyes scanning the shadows for any sign of their pursuers. Luca glanced over his shoulder, catching the flicker of movement. Niccolo and Francesca were gaining on them, their figures darting between the statues like specters in the night.

“They’re closing in,” Luca muttered, tightening his grip on the encrypted briefcase he was carrying. His voice was low, but the tension was palpable. Isabella’s pulse raced, but her mind remained sharp.

“They won’t stop until they have it all,” she whispered, her gaze hard. She knew that this chase wasn’t just about documents. Niccolo wanted to shut them down for good.

As they reached the center of the piazza, Marco abruptly pulled them to a halt. “No time to run. We make our stand here,” he growled, his hand instinctively moving to his side, where he carried his concealed weapon.

Isabella’s heart pounded in her chest. The entire city seemed to hold its breath as the distant sound of footsteps grew louder, closer. The narrow streets leading into the piazza were bathed in shadow, and the figures of Niccolo and Francesca finally emerged, their dark silhouettes menacing as they approached.

“You’re trapped,” Niccolo called out, his voice echoing through the square with a cruel confidence. “Hand over the evidence, Isabella. Don’t make this harder than it has to be.”

Francesca stood beside him, her icy gaze fixed on them, her expression unreadable but cold. She held a small device in her hand, something that pulsed faintly with a red light—a jammer, meant to disable any attempt at transmitting data.

Isabella clenched her fists, knowing they were moments away from confrontation. “You think you’ve won just because you got close?” she said, her voice defiant. “You have no idea what you’re up against.”

Niccolo chuckled darkly, stepping forward. “You’ve always been too smart for your own good. But that’s the problem with being clever—you forget how easy it is to lose everything.”

Without warning, Niccolo lunged. Marco reacted instantly, stepping forward and shoving Niccolo back. The two men grappled, their bodies crashing against the stone fountain with a force that echoed through the piazza. Luca, in the chaos, ducked behind a nearby pillar, shielding the briefcase while Francesca tried to edge closer.

“You’re not taking anything from us!” Luca shouted, his voice echoing with determination.

Francesca raised the jammer, her lips curving into a sinister smile. “I don’t need to take anything, darling. I just need to destroy it.” She pressed the button, and instantly, a high-pitched whine filled the air as the jammer activated. Isabella felt a sudden surge of panic, but then, just as quickly, her fear subsided. She had planned for this.

“You’re too late, Francesca,” Isabella said, stepping out from behind the fountain, her gaze unwavering. “The key evidence you’re so desperate for? It’s not here. It’s been uploaded, encrypted. Even if you steal what you can touch, you’ll be chasing shadows.”

For a moment, Niccolo and Francesca hesitated, the weight of Isabella’s words sinking in. But the hesitation was brief.

Francesca’s expression darkened. “We’ll see about that.” In one swift movement, she turned, and Niccolo delivered a hard blow to Marco’s gut, sending him staggering backward. With his momentum, Niccolo snatched the briefcase from Luca’s hands, grinning victoriously as he held it up. “This is all we need. You can keep your clever AI tricks, Isabella. We’ll take what we’ve got.”

Isabella’s heart raced, but her face remained calm. “You think that briefcase holds your victory?” she asked, her voice low and icy. “All it holds is your defeat. You’ve underestimated what’s inside, Niccolo. Good luck cracking it.”

Niccolo’s grin faltered for a moment, but he quickly recovered. “We’ll see who’s laughing when we’re done with it.”

With that, Niccolo and Francesca darted into the shadows once again, disappearing into the narrow streets, their footsteps fading into the night. The piazza was silent once more, save for the heavy breathing of Isabella, Luca, and Marco.

Marco straightened, wincing slightly as he rubbed his ribs. “Damn it. They got away,” he muttered. “We lost the briefcase.”

Luca shook his head. “No. They lost.”

Isabella exhaled, the adrenaline still coursing through her veins. “We’ve still got the critical data. That briefcase was just a decoy. The real evidence is safe—encrypted and hidden in a place they’ll never find.”

Luca shot her a questioning look. “Are you sure?”

Isabella nodded. “Absolutely. I designed the encryption myself. It’s hidden in layers they won’t even know how to begin unraveling.”

There was a long pause as they stood in the quiet of the piazza, the weight of the night’s events heavy in the air. Marco sighed, glancing toward the direction Niccolo and Francesca had fled. “They’ll be back. They won’t stop until they’ve torn everything apart.”

“We’ll be ready for them,” Isabella said, her voice steady and resolute. “But right now, we need to regroup.”

Luca nodded, his gaze lingering on her for a moment. “You saved us tonight, Isabella. Your AI tech, your planning… we couldn’t have done this without you.”

Isabella met his eyes, the briefest flicker of warmth passing between them. “We’re not out of the woods yet. This was only the beginning.”

The night hung heavily around them, the weight of what had just occurred pressing in. But despite the tension, a new resolve had settled over the group. They weren’t beaten. Not yet.

“We need to find out where that coded message leads,” Luca said, his voice low. “We might be closer to the truth than we realize.”

Isabella’s eyes narrowed, the flicker of determination returning. “Then we follow it. All the way to the Vatican, if we have to.”

A chilling wind swept through the piazza, carrying with it the promise of even darker days ahead.

Scene 4: Strategic Retreat

The dim glow of streetlamps bathed the narrow streets of Rome in a soft, golden hue as Isabella, Luca, and Marco walked in silence, their footsteps echoing against the ancient cobblestones. The weight of the chase still hung in the air, but the adrenaline had faded, leaving behind only exhaustion and the heavy realization of what had just transpired.

They reached a small, tucked-away alley, a safe distance from the chaos of Piazza Navona. Marco leaned against a weathered wall, lighting a cigarette, the glow briefly illuminating his tired face. “We got lucky back there,” he muttered between drags. “Too close for comfort.”

Luca, who had been silent since the chase ended, finally spoke, his voice tight with concern. “They got the briefcase. That was everything.”

Isabella shook her head, still catching her breath. “Not everything.”

Marco raised an eyebrow, flicking the ash from his cigarette. “What do you mean?”

Isabella straightened, brushing the loose strands of hair from her face. “The physical documents, the briefcase—they’re important, yes, but they’re not the heart of the investigation. The most crucial evidence is digital. And that’s where AI comes in.”

Luca’s brow furrowed. “You keep saying that, Isabella, but how exactly does this AI of yours keep the data safe? They took the briefcase—if they crack it—”

“They won’t crack it,” she interrupted, her voice calm but firm. She took a step toward Luca and Marco, her eyes steady as she explained. “Let me put it in simple terms. Imagine AI as the most sophisticated lock and key system in the world. Only, it’s not just one lock—it’s a thousand, layered on top of each other, each one different and more complex than the last.”

Marco nodded slowly, but Luca still seemed skeptical. “And that protects the data how, exactly?”

“Alright, think of it like this,” Isabella continued, adjusting her tone to something more accessible. “Let’s say you have a vault, and inside that vault is a priceless artifact—that’s the data. Now, to even get near the vault, you need a key. That’s the encryption. But here’s the catch—each time someone tries to get close to the vault, the AI changes the locks. Every attempt they make to break in? It makes the next layer of protection even harder to get through. So, instead of just one wall, it’s like they’re running into an endless maze, one that keeps shifting.”

Marco took a long drag from his cigarette, nodding thoughtfully. “So, even if they get the briefcase…”

“They won’t have what matters,” Isabella finished. “The real evidence is saved on a secure AI server, completely encrypted. The data itself is fragmented, meaning it’s broken up into tiny pieces and scattered across different systems. Only I can reassemble it. Niccolo and Francesca could try for years, and they’d still be lost in the encryption.”

Luca ran a hand through his hair, visibly relaxing at the explanation. “Okay, that makes sense. But are you sure they can’t find a way in?”

Isabella smiled faintly, a glimmer of confidence in her eyes. “I designed it myself. Niccolo might be clever, but he’s not that clever.”

Marco exhaled slowly, a cloud of smoke swirling in the cold night air. “Well, that’s a relief, at least. But it won’t stop them from trying. We’ve got a target on our backs now.”

The group fell silent, the tension thick in the air. Even with the data secured, the danger wasn’t over. Niccolo and Francesca wouldn’t stop until they had what they wanted—or until Isabella and her team were out of the way for good.

Luca finally spoke, his voice quiet but firm. “So, what’s the next step?”

Isabella looked up, her gaze hardening. “We keep moving. We regroup, we lay low for a bit. But we don’t stop. There’s more at stake here than just some documents—this is about the truth, about what really happened to my grandfather.”

Marco stubbed out his cigarette, nodding grimly. “Agreed. But we need to be smart about this. Niccolo’s not just a thug—he’s got resources, and he won’t hesitate to use them.”

“I know,” Isabella said, her voice laced with determination. “But we’re not giving up. We still have the advantage, as long as we stay ahead.”

Luca glanced around the quiet alley, his expression serious. “We need a plan. If Niccolo and Francesca are willing to risk so much to steal that briefcase, then whatever we’re chasing is bigger than we thought.”

Isabella nodded, her mind already racing ahead. “Exactly. And that’s why we need to move carefully. The Vatican connection, the encrypted data, everything ties back to something much larger than just a family secret.”

The night seemed to close in around them, the quiet of Rome feeling more oppressive than ever. The streets were empty, but the shadows felt alive with unseen dangers. Every step they took from this point forward would be more dangerous than the last.

“I suggest we find a secure location,” Marco said, pushing off the wall and glancing around cautiously. “Somewhere they won’t expect us. We can regroup, plan our next move.”

Isabella met his gaze, her eyes steady. “Agreed. But we don’t have much time. Whatever’s coming, we need to be ready.”

Luca looked at Isabella, a hint of admiration in his voice. “You’re not backing down, are you?”

Isabella smiled, though it didn’t reach her eyes. “No. Not until we have the truth.”

The tension lingered in the air as the group began walking again, disappearing into the shadows of Rome’s quiet streets. Despite the danger that loomed over them, Isabella’s mind was clear—she knew they were getting closer to unraveling the mystery. And no matter how dark the path ahead became, she wouldn’t stop until they had the answers they were searching for.

Scene 5: The Unexpected Twist

Later that night, back in Isabella’s apartment, the tension lingered like a shadow over the room. Luca sat at the table, his eyes scanning the encrypted data on Isabella’s laptop. Marco paced by the window, his nerves still on edge.

"This data..." Luca began, his voice hesitant. "There’s something strange about it."

Isabella moved closer, her brow furrowing in concern. "What do you mean?"

Luca zoomed in on the screen, revealing a series of strange patterns hidden within the data. "It’s a coded message," he said, his voice filled with urgency. "Giovanni must have hidden it here. It’s a clue... to something bigger."

Isabella’s eyes widened as the realization sank in. "A clue? To what?"

Luca turned to her, his expression grave. "To a secret vault in the Vatican. Giovanni was closer to the truth than we ever imagined."

They exchanged a tense look, the weight of the discovery pressing down on them. The stakes had just risen, and they knew the next step would be more dangerous than anything they’d faced before.

"We’re closer than we thought," Isabella whispered, her heart pounding with both fear and anticipation.
