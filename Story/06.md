Chapter 6: Hiring Marco Falcone


---

Scene 1: Arrival at the Office

Late afternoon sunlight spilled across the cobblestones outside an old building in a quieter part of Rome. The noise of the bustling city was muted here, replaced by the occasional passing car or a distant echo of voices. Isabella Benedetti stood in front of a faded door with a frosted glass panel. Stenciled on it, barely visible under layers of grime, were the words: "Marco Falcone, Private Investigator."

Isabella hesitated. The weight of her decision hung heavily on her shoulders. She had spent weeks combing through her grandfather Giovanni’s papers, coming up short on answers. She didn’t trust the police—not with a case like this, not when she suspected powerful figures inside the Vatican might be involved. But hiring a private investigator? A gritty, street-smart one at that? This wasn’t something she was familiar with.

She clenched her fists, her resolve hardening. There was no going back. She wasn’t just here to chase a mystery—she was here to uncover the truth behind her grandfather’s murder. Isabella took a deep breath, reached out, and pushed the door open.

Scene 2: Meeting Marco

The smell of old paper, mixed with lingering cigarette smoke, greeted Isabella as she stepped into Marco Falcone's office. The dim light from the desk lamp cast long shadows across the room, adding to the air of mystery. Marco sat behind his worn-out desk, cigarette hanging loosely from his lips, eyes sharp beneath his fedora. He barely looked up as Isabella entered, just a casual flick of his gaze before returning to his papers.

"Marco Falcone?" Isabella asked, her voice steady, though her hands were clenched around her handbag.

Marco gave a noncommittal grunt, pulling the cigarette from his mouth. "Depends who's asking. You don't look like my usual crowd." His voice was rough, gravelly, a contrast to the sharp intellect dancing in his eyes.

Isabella straightened her back. "My name is Isabella Benedetti. I'm here because I need your help with a... delicate matter."

Marco's eyes lingered on her for a moment longer, sizing her up. "Benedetti, huh? Name rings a bell." He flicked ash into the tray beside him. "I'm guessing you're not just here to ask about a missing cat."

Isabella took a breath, gathering her composure. "My grandfather, Giovanni Benedetti, was murdered twenty-four years ago. The case was never solved. The Vatican—”

Marco cut her off with a low whistle. “The Vatican, huh? And you think poking into old wounds there’s a good idea?” He leaned back in his chair, arms crossing over his chest. “Lady, you realize who you’re messing with, right? I’ve had a few clients come through thinking they could get answers about the Vatican. Guess where they are now?”

Isabella didn’t flinch. “I know it’s dangerous. I’ve spent my whole life in the shadow of that danger. But this isn’t just about the past—it’s about the truth. I’ve found letters, clues that my grandfather left behind. Someone wanted him dead for what he knew, and I believe those same people are still out there.”

Marco raised an eyebrow, unimpressed. "And you think you're the one to bring it all to light? Look, lady, I’m not in the business of chasing ghosts. Especially ones that have Vatican power breathing down their neck. You’re young, educated, and clearly not from my side of the tracks. You don’t need this headache."

Isabella stepped forward, her voice sharp, cutting through the smoke-filled air. "I chose you because you're the only one with the guts to handle it. Everyone else I approached either backed off or tried to cover their tracks. I need someone who’s not afraid to get his hands dirty, someone who doesn’t care about reputation or who they’re up against."

Marco narrowed his eyes, studying her with renewed interest. "You think flattery's gonna get me to take this case? Look, kid, I don’t play nice with anyone, especially not with someone coming in here with a 'Vatican conspiracy' story. I've had people try to bring that place down and all it did was put them six feet under or worse."

Isabella’s jaw tightened. “I’m not here to bring them down. I’m here to uncover the truth. My grandfather died for it, and if I have to face the same fate, then so be it. But I won’t stop until I know what happened. I owe him that much.”

Marco’s eyes flickered with something—a glimmer of respect, perhaps—but his tone remained hardened. “This ain't a fairytale, lady. The Vatican doesn't just cover things up—they erase them. You step on the wrong toes, and you won't even see it coming. They’ve got power in places you can’t even imagine. You’re risking your life for a ghost.”

“And yet you haven’t turned me away,” Isabella shot back, crossing her arms. “If you really didn’t want this case, you would’ve said so already. You’re curious, aren’t you? This isn’t just some run-of-the-mill case. You know something’s there, something worth uncovering.”

Marco stared at her for a long moment, then sighed, leaning forward and crushing the cigarette in the ashtray. "You're stubborn, I’ll give you that. But you're stepping into a world of shadows, Miss Benedetti. The kind of shadows that swallow people whole. Once you go down this path, there's no turning back."

"I know," Isabella replied, her voice firm. "But I have to continue what my grandfather started. He believed in something—something important enough to die for. I need to know what it was, and I need someone like you to help me find it."

Marco sat in silence for a moment, the weight of her words hanging in the air. He rubbed his temples before meeting her gaze. “Fine. I’ll take your case. But know this—I work my way, and I don’t babysit. You stay out of the dangerous spots, you hear me?”

Isabella exhaled, feeling a mix of relief and determination. “I can take care of myself.”

“Yeah, we’ll see about that,” Marco muttered. He stood and opened a drawer, pulling out a small notepad. “I’m gonna need everything you’ve got—letters, notes, anything your grandfather left behind. And if there’s anyone else sniffing around this case, they’ll come after you next.”

“I’m ready for that,” she said quietly.

Marco paused, his sharp eyes locking onto hers. "No, you’re not. Not really. But you will be." He tore a page from the notepad, scribbling his number. “We start with what you’ve got. You bring those letters to me tomorrow. Don’t go looking for trouble in the meantime.”

He handed her the note, his rough fingers brushing hers briefly, and for the first time, his expression softened, if only slightly. “You’re diving into some deep waters, kid. Let’s hope you know how to swim.”

Isabella pocketed the note, her resolve even stronger. “I don’t have a choice, Marco. I’m in this until the end.”

Marco gave her a long, considering look, then nodded. “Tomorrow then. And keep your eyes open. From here on out, nothing is as it seems.”

As Isabella turned to leave, Marco’s voice followed her. "One last thing—don’t trust anyone too easily, even the ones closest to you. You’ll be surprised where loyalties lie when the Vatican’s involved."

Isabella stopped, her back stiffening as she absorbed his warning. Without turning around, she replied, “I know. That’s why I’m here.”

As the door closed behind her, Marco watched the smoke curling from his cigarette, his mind already racing through the layers of danger Isabella had just pulled him into.

Scene 3: The Partnership Begins (Expanded)

Marco’s office, transitioning to the busy street outside as they leave.

Isabella sat across from Marco in his dimly lit office, her posture straight and composed, but the flicker of tension in her eyes betrayed her unease. She pulled out the coded letter, unfolding it carefully, placing it between them on the cluttered desk. Alongside it were some of Giovanni’s old notes, scribbled with the familiar handwriting she had long cherished.

"This," she began, her voice smooth, practiced, "is what I’ve uncovered. My grandfather's notes suggest he was onto something, something significant enough to get him killed." She spoke with sharp clarity, as if presenting a case to a boardroom full of executives. Her tone was direct, every word placed deliberately, exuding confidence and intelligence. "The coded letter mentions certain figures, references historical events in Vatican history that don’t match public records."

Marco leaned back in his chair, his eyes narrowing as he studied the documents. His fedora, hung carelessly on a coat rack, cast a long shadow over the room, but his cigarette glowed faintly in the dimness. He listened closely, not interrupting yet, but his keen instincts were already piecing things together. His office smelled of old leather and tobacco, an environment far from the high-tech boardrooms Isabella was used to, but she felt oddly comfortable here.

After a moment, he leaned forward, resting his elbows on the desk. "You're saying these notes suggest a conspiracy that goes back decades, maybe longer?" His voice had a raspy edge, each question probing deeper. "And you think these people… these 'certain figures' in the Vatican—" he tapped the coded letter with his finger "—are still alive? Still pulling the strings?"

Isabella met his gaze without flinching. "Yes. And it’s not just speculation. There are hints in my grandfather’s research that connect them to modern events. They’ve worked hard to bury any trace of it. But he was onto something big, something they couldn’t allow him to reveal."

Marco picked up the letter, inspecting it closely, his cigarette dangling from his lips. "What exactly was Giovanni trying to expose?"

"The Vatican’s historical records... altered, perhaps manipulated to conceal certain truths. His papers suggest that the original teachings of Christianity were compromised, merged with cultural elements that have been kept hidden to maintain control. If that truth ever got out..." she paused, letting the weight of her words sink in.

He sat back, intrigued. "You’re talking about something that could shake the foundations of the Church."

Isabella nodded. "Exactly. And that’s why we need to be careful. These people are powerful, untouchable in some circles. If they realize we’re getting close, they’ll come after us just like they came after him."

Marco’s expression shifted as he took in the complexity of the case. He inhaled deeply from his cigarette before crushing it in the ashtray, the tension in the room thickening. "You realize what you’re asking me to do isn’t a simple case. If we go after these people, there’s no turning back. You could get yourself killed, too."

"I know the risks," Isabella replied, her tone steady, "but I can’t walk away. Not after what they did to him."

Marco watched her for a long moment, then let out a sigh. "Alright. I’m in. But I’ll need time to crack this code and figure out what we’re really dealing with here. You said there’s more?"

She handed him another set of notes. "Giovanni’s research on early Vatican history. There’s a section about two early popes, Linus and Cletus. He was convinced there was something off about the historical accounts of their roles. I think it connects to the bigger picture."

Marco flipped through the notes, his eyes scanning the pages. "I’ll go over this and see what jumps out. In the meantime, we need to keep our meetings low profile. No one can know we’re working together. Not yet."

They agreed to meet again in a few days to discuss the next steps. Marco walked her to the door, a rare look of seriousness crossing his normally tough, easygoing features.

As Isabella stepped out onto the busy street, the city buzzed with life around her. People hurried past, oblivious to the mounting tension that now weighed heavily on her shoulders. The sunlight felt harsh after the dim atmosphere of Marco’s office, and as she walked, a mix of relief and anxiety washed over her.

She was no closer to finding all the answers, but at least now, she had an ally. Marco’s sharp instincts and relentless approach gave her hope. But the deeper they dug, the more dangerous this would become.

She tightened her grip on her bag, her thoughts racing. She couldn't afford to look back now—too much was at stake. Her grandfather’s death was just the beginning. Now, she was diving headfirst into a conspiracy that could unravel everything she had ever believed about her family... and the Vatican.

Scene 4: The Cliffhanger

The sun had begun to set as Isabella stepped out of Marco’s office, the cool evening air wrapping around her. The streets of Rome, though still bustling with life, felt distant—almost muted in her current state of mind. Her thoughts raced, filled with the implications of what she had just set in motion.

As she walked down the narrow street, she felt an unsettling sensation—a prickling at the back of her neck, as though she were being watched. She glanced around, her eyes scanning the shadows between the buildings, the parked cars along the sidewalk. And then she saw it.

A figure, standing across the street, partially obscured by the shadow of a doorway. It was too far to make out any details, but the posture—the stillness—was unnerving. The figure didn’t move, didn’t make any effort to hide or approach. It simply stood there, watching her.

Isabella’s heart raced. She quickened her pace, her mind racing with possibilities. Was Marco right? Had someone already marked her? As she turned the corner, she glanced back—only to find the figure was gone.

Provocative Cliffhanger:

The paranoia crept into her veins like a slow, freezing current. Isabella realized, with a sinking feeling, that the investigation wasn’t just about unearthing her grandfather’s secrets. She was already a target.
